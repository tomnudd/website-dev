					<h4>History:</h4>
<p><blockquote><ol>
					<li><b>1867 -</b> Edward A. Calahan invents printing telegraph for stock prices.</li>
					<li><b>1884 -</b> Herman Hollerith files a patent for the Tabulator. This was a device that could rapidly read numbers encoded by punching holes onto a set of cards. Its basic function was to count or add numbers represented by the holes and print them on paper. </li>
					<li><b>1885 -</b> William Burrough files a patent for a mechanical adding machine. It printed numbers, added them up, then printed the sum.</li>
					<li><b>1948 -</b> IBM introduced the 604 Electronic Calculating Punch. This could perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division very quickly.</li>
					<li><b>1971 -</b> Donald C. Wetzel receives a patent for the 'automatic teller banking machine. This used a magnetically coded strip on a plastic card along with a personal identification number which allowed users to withdraw cash from their bank account.</li>
					<li><b>1977 -</b> Don Coppersmith, a mathematician and cryptographer, develops the Data Encryption Standard.</li>
					<li><b>1982 -</b> First Bloomberg terminal installed at Merrill Lynch. This machine monitors real-time financial market data and allows trading to happen on an electronic trading platform.
					<li><b>2005 -</b> Development, production and commercialization of electronic calculators from 1964 to 1973.</li>
					<li><b>2010 -</b> Invention of public-key cryptography. This helped secure electronic transfers and e-commerce.</li>
					<li><b>2014 -</b> Apple launches the Apple Pay contactless pay system. This process takes about 2 seconds.</li>

	<h4>Today's Applications:</h4>

	<p><blockquote>Today, there are many new applications for financial technology and it is changing the structure of the financial industry very rapidly. It's made the industry far more efficient: from better customer service to quicker and more efficient trading through the use of algorithms. Below are a few examples from today.

	<ul>
		<li><b>Fraud detection -</b> This is done through machine learning. AI software will detect and send up a warning when it spots a transaction that could possibly be fraudulent. It is then up to human workers to investigate the transactions and decide whether it's fraud or not. This makes spotting fraudulent transactions far less time consuming and efficient. Whereas before, attempting to detect sophisticated attacks was very expensive and time-consuming for banks. With better machine learning algorithms, statistical modelling, and process automation, machines can use historical data to predict the likelihood of a fraudulent transaction and predict them before they occur. This reduces effort by about 50%.</li>
    <li><b>Blockchains -</b> Used for digital transactions. They are very good at reducing the time and money for banks and consumers to transfer money. They ensure transparency, this minimizes risk, human error and transactions fees.</li>
		<li><b>Biometrics -</b> This is the application of vocal patterns, irises, finerprints etc to improve the level of authentication required for transactions. This also means that the customer doesn't need to remember multiple passwords and reduces the likelyhood that criminals could guess the password and be able to perform transactions on that customer's account.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Problems:</h4>

	<p><blockquote>These are problems that affect any Fintech company that wants to continue to operate in today's market.

		<ul>
			<li><b>Data security -</b> If the personal details of customers are stored, a company will have to be very rigorous when it comes to protection from hacking. Any data breach is a direct liability to a company and will ruin their reputation, customers need to feel secure with that company.</li>
			<li><b>Cyber attacks -</b> These companies are very vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DDoS attacks</a>. This is where the attacker uses several IP addresses to either flood the service or crash the service. A Fintech company needs to have measures to prevent this or their services will be unable to be used and they can be extorted.</li>
		</ul>
