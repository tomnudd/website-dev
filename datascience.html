				Data science is a field that uses algorithms and systems to analyse data and determine patterns that can then be used to predict patterns and trends.

				<dt class="col-sm-3">History of the word 'data science'</dt>
				<dd class= "col-sm-9">Originally, in the 1960s, the term 'data science' was used in place of 'computer science.' A distinction between 'computer science' and 'data science' was first clearly noted in C.F Jeff Wu's inaugaral lecture, which was called "Statistics = Data Science?". Data science was introduced as an independent discipline in 2001 by William Cleveland. In 2012 Harvard Business Review had an article called "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century." As you can see, much progress has been made when it comes to the definition of "data scientist".</dd>
				<dt class="col-sm-3">Applications of data science</dt>
				<dd class= "col-sm-9">Data science has several applications, from reccomending you movies and shows on Netflix based on your watch history to gaming. Some of the applications have been shown below.</dd>

						<h5>Personalised Advertisements</h5>
							<p>Coca Cola is one brand that analyses big data to ensure advertising efforts successfully address and engage with the public. They ensure they know exactly what the public wants and how they want it delivered. This is particularly important as competition grows increasingly fast. Before we know it, all brands will need to rely on algorithms to survive against competition.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='col'>
						<h5>Detecting Fraud</h5>
							<p>Experts are currently predicting credit card fraud to hit $32 billion in 2020, which puts into perspective why data science is necessary. Fraud detection problems are also known as 'classification' problems. Spam detectors are also an example of these types of problems. These algorithms analyse previous data and detect abnormal behaviour such as unusual huge spends or spending on products a customer would not usually buy.</p>
