          <p>the first hybrid vehicle</p>
          <ul>
            <li>in 1997, Toyota launched the <a href='https://www.toyota.co.uk/new-cars/prius/'>Prius</a>, the world's first mass produced hybrid car</li>
            <li>the name is the Latin word for <i>before</i>, as the car was believed to be the predecessor for future vehicles</li>
            <li>a 58hp engine was paired with a 40hp electric motor to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy</li>
            <li>the Prius set the stage for a wave of more fuel efficient vehicles, which continues to this day</li>

          <p>electric vehicles today</p>
          <ul>
            <li>nowadays, electric cars can travel hundres of miles on a single charge</li>
            <li>in 2016, more than 2 million electric vehicles were sold worldwide</li>
            <li>they are also becoming more affordable - the <a href='https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/model3'>Tesla Model 3</a> retails for just US$35k</li>
            <li>electic vehicles, such as the <a href='https://www.bmw.co.uk/bmw-cars/bmw-i/2018-i3-and-i3s#gref'>BMW i3</a>, are often built from sustainable materials in an attempt to promote a change in mindset of the automotive industry</li>

          <p>the future of electric cars</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Volvo has plegded to equip every engine they produce with an electric motor by 2019</li>
            <li>it is expected that 20-25% of all vehicles sales in the US will be electric by 2030</li>
            <li>by 2040, all cars sold in the UK will be <a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40723581'>hybrid</a> or fully electric</li>
            <li>Porsche recently announced that it wil stop making diesel vehicles and instead focus on petrol hybrid systems</li>

          <ul>
            <li>many cars, especially those manufactured by high-end companies, feature advanced driver aids</li>
            <li>these systems utilise cutting-edge technology to reduce the strain on the driver</li>
            <li>some <a href='https://www.bmw.co.uk/bmw-ownership/connecteddrive/driver-assistance/intelligent-driving#gref'>example</a> driver aids are
              <ul>
                <li>adaptive cruise control</li>

          <p>autonomous parking</p>
          <ul>
            <li>as well as aids for use on the open road, many cars feature parking assistance systems</li>
            <li>the majority of these use parking sensors to recognise parallel parking spaces</li>
            <li>often, the driver doesn't even have to control the accelerator and brake during self-parking</li>
            <li>some cars, such as the BMW 7 series, can be driven out of a garage using just the key</li>
