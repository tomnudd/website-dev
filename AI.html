					<p class="text-justify">Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a very broad term for what is arguably one of the fastest growing areas of computer science. The initial ideas and concepts of AI were first conceived in the mid 1900's which may seem crazy, as to many people it has only recently become a thing. The pioneers of AI where thinking theoretically rather than practically because back then, with the computational power they had available to them, it would have been near impossible to try and implement it practically.</p>

				<div class="col">
					<p class="text-justify">AI is being implemented in many aspects and areas of life nowadays from search predictions and shopping trends to predicting weather patterns to controlling the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/home/">Mars rover!</a> Another area closely linked to this is the development of the driverless car. There are many manufacturers working on these cars such as Audi, BMW, Bosch, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Tesla and more!</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p class="text-justify">A big fear people have with AI is that a lot of people think that the world will be overtaken by a "rogue" AI. This is a heavily debated topic as there is some truth to the argument as there is a belief that if an AI is told to minimize human deaths then they could think that killing all humans now would be better as it reduces all future deaths by an infinite factor. However, there are papers that have been written stating that a lot of these fears are due to what is known as "good story bias" which is basically saying that people have made these things happen in films or stories beceause without this there wouldn't be a good story line.</p>
